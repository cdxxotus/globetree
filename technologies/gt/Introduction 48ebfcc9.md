# Key components

1. Structure-supporting trees: Fagus sylvatica, a tree species well-suited for the Haute Savoie region, will serve as the primary structural component, providing stability and strength to the Globe Tree.
2. Tree strain variation: A diverse array of tree strains, including Fagus sylvatica and other species, have been incorporated to enhance biodiversity, resilience, and aesthetic appeal.
3. Substrate depth optimization: A detailed analysis of substrate depth requirements for different plant species ensures optimal soil volume and weight distribution across the floors.
4. Automated irrigation system: A state-of-the-art irrigation system monitors and adjusts water supply for each plant species, promoting efficient water use and optimal growth.
5. Wind-resistant structure: The Globe Tree's design includes wind-resistant elements and materials to minimize potential damage from strong winds and storms.
6. Controlled-release fertilizer: The use of controlled-release fertilizers in the substrate layers provides a steady supply of nutrients over an extended period, reducing the need for frequent fertilization.
7. Water collection and purification: Advanced water collection and purification systems have been integrated into the design to ensure a reliable supply of clean water for irrigation and other purposes.
8. Renewable energy: The incorporation of solar panels and turbines will harness renewable energy to power the Globe Tree, promoting energy independence and reducing its environmental impact.
9. Liana connections: Bioluminescent Humulus lupulus lianas connect plants and support the distribution of water and nutrients throughout the structure, while trees provide structural support for each floor.
10. Modular floor design (from earlier suggestions): The floors feature a modular design, allowing for easy reconfiguration and customization to adapt to changing needs and requirements over time.
11. Soil cover: A combination of Thymus serpyllum and Sedum spp. will provide ground cover, stabilizing the soil and aiding in nutrient retention.
12. Floors: Each floor will be composed of a mycelium-contaminated biotextile layer and a 2-meter layer of substrate for tree roots, Thymus serpyllum, and Sedum spp., ensuring a strong and eco-friendly foundation.
13. Irrigation system: An efficient porous pipe network will provide optimal irrigation for each substrate layer, ensuring consistent and effective water distribution.
14. Genetic engineering: Advanced gene-editing techniques, such as CRISPR-Cas9 or viral transduction, will be employed to introduce the GA20ox gene into Fagus sylvatica. This gene, involved in gibberellin biosynthesis, has been associated with increased growth in some plants and will contribute to the structural integrity of the Globe Tree.

The impact of the Globe Tree project is manifold. It showcases the potential of bioengineering in creating sustainable and adaptive living spaces, increases biodiversity and resilience within an urban environment, and highlights the importance of integrating renewable energy sources and efficient resource management systems. Additionally, the Globe Tree serves as a demonstration of how humans can coexist with nature in a harmonious and mutually beneficial relationship, inspiring further innovation in the field of bioengineered architecture.

The Globe Tree represents a bold step forward in sustainable architecture, blending cutting-edge technology with eco-conscious design principles to create a living space that enriches the environment and fosters community engagement.
